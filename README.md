# Soon Engine [Ongoing]

A Vulkan game engine to practice my C++ skill and 3D programming.

## Disclaimer

Switch to the CleanUp Branch to see the latest version of the engine, but it doesn't compile because the engine underwent some feature additions.  
Soon is a learning project that is ongoing and not complete.  
Feel free to contact me if you have any ideas or want to discuss about it.  

## Status

The engine has undergone many architectural changes. I wanted to experience a lot of things.  
It is not yet very readable, but as it develops it should become more comfortable to read.  
Today the project is only at the beginning.
